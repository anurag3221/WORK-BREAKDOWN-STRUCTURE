**What Is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?**
---------------------------------------------

**A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a visual, hierarchical and
deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project.** It is a helpful
diagram for project managers because it allows them to break down their
project scope and visualize all the tasks required to complete their
projects.

All the steps of project work are outlined in the work breakdown
structure chart, which makes it an essential project planning tool. The
final project deliverable, as well as the tasks and work packages
associated with it rest on top of the WBS diagram, and the WBS levels
below subdivide the project scope to indicate the tasks, deliverables
and work packages that are needed to complete the project from start to
finish.

**Why Use a WBS In Project Management?**
----------------------------------------

Making a WBS is the first step in developing a project schedule. It
defines all the work that needs to be completed (and in what order) to
achieve the project goals and objectives. By visualizing your project in
this manner, you can understand your project scope, and allocate
resources for all your project tasks.

A well-constructed work breakdown structure helps with important project
management process groups and knowledge areas such as:

-   Project Planning, Project Scheduling and Project Budgeting

-   Risk Management, Resource Management, Task Management and Team
    > Management

The following is the snippet of my WBS,
